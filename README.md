This is [Yeeshani](https://evewho.com/character/2114616290).    
I'm part of [Signal Cartel](https://signalcartel.org/) an Eve Online Corp with a focus on peaceful exploration.    
I'm part of the [SC Wiki](https://wiki.signalcartel.space/Public:About_Signal_Cartel) team so most of the things in here will be related to that.

If you want to start Eve here is my [Eve referral code](https://www.eveonline.com/signup/?invc=00318f8f-602e-4a2a-a9ac-bd657ebbdb79) giving you an easier start.
